"""EA Test 3 benchmark: momentum conservation over a small obstruction.

Runs the UK Environment Agency "Benchmarking of 2D Hydraulic Modelling
Packages" Test 3 from the published May-2010 dataset
(``benchmark_assets/Test3 dataset 2010``): the georeferenced ASCII
DEM (``test3DEM.asc``, prismatic 1:200 slope with two depressions separated
by an obstruction) and the upstream inflow hydrograph (``Test3BC.csv``,
65.5 m^3/s plateau, 1310 m^3 total). Modelled area per the spec: x in
[0, 300] m by y in [0, 100] m, Manning n = 0.01 uniform, dry-bed initial
condition, run to t = 900 s. Gauges per the spec: Point 1 (150, 50) in the
first depression, Point 2 (250, 50) in the second.

The physics under test: whether the solver's momentum (inertia) terms carry
fast flow over a barrier it could never cross by water-surface gradient
alone. The inflow travels ~150 m down the 1:200 slope and arrives at the
first depression as a fast bore. By design the total inflow volume is *just
sufficient* to fill the first depression to the obstruction crest — an
inertia-free (diffusive-wave) model moves water strictly down surface
gradients, so at best it fills the depression and stops, and Point 2 stays
dry; only conserved momentum carries water over the crest, so any settled
pond at Point 2 is the momentum signature the published intercomparison
looks for.

One adaptation: this solver has no open-boundary inflow, so the hydrograph
is injected as near-boundary *volume* sources (a line of point sources
hugging the upstream wall). This is conservative for the discriminator — the
sources add mass with zero momentum, and all momentum is acquired on the
slope descent exactly as in the published setup (all other boundaries are
closed per the spec; this solver's walls are reflective).

Every backend run is paired with an untimed *still-water control*: the same
volume placed at rest in the first depression, filled to the crest (the
deepest lake any gradient-driven transport could build). A well-balanced
solver must keep the control's Point 2 dry — if it leaks over the crest from
rest, Point 2 ponding is a numerical well-balance artifact, not momentum,
and the case fails with an explicit reason.

There is no closed form (model-*intercomparison* benchmark); acceptance is
invariant/qualitative: mass balance against the injected hydrograph volume,
positivity / wetting-drying stability, a settled Point 1 pond, both pond
surfaces below the crest, and — the momentum signature — a measurable pond
at Point 2 past the obstruction.

Backends are configurable (`--backends`) across the retained Vulkan solver
implementations. The release is a pure initial condition with zero sources.
`--gif` renders untimed extra runs into a top-down depth-heatmap
animation and a longitudinal side-view (bed + water-surface profile)
animation; timed runs are never the frame source, so perf stays clean.
